Predicting Corporate Cash Burn (2021â€“2024)

This project uses financial statement data from public energy companies to predict whether a company will burn cash in the next fiscal year â€” a critical signal for startups and many other firms.

Requirements: Python, Pandas, PyCaret, H2O.ai, Matplotlib

Problem Statement

Can we predict if a public company will burn cash next year, using its financial statements from this year?

Target: burn_cash (1 if next-year Free Cash Flow < 0, else 0)

Use case: Corporate finance teams, startup analysts, or risk management for early-stage or capital-intensive sectors

Data

Source: Manually extracted from Perplexity Finance (perplexity.ai/finance)

Companies: 32 (Renewable & Nuclear Energy + Industrial sectors)

Years: 2021â€“2024

Rows: 123 after cleaning

Workflow

1. Data Engineering

Merged Balance Sheet + Cash Flow statements

Added future targets: shifted next-year Free Cash Flow (FCF), Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

Created binary burn_cash label

2. Feature Engineering

~10+ derived features: investment ratios, working capital changes, debt repayment ratio, and YoY deltas

3. Modeling

AutoML with PyCaret: binary classification (used in final version due to small data size)

H2O.ai AutoML: experimental run

Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, F1, MCC, Recall

Lessons Learned

AutoML tools require strong feature engineering and domain knowledge

Even with clean financial data, data size limits generalization

Feature engineering, shifted targets, explored 2 AutoML tools
